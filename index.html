	<h2 class="even_heading">About</h2>
	<p>We will be providing basic information about baseball and softball. This information is just the beginning of comparing the sports similarities and
	differences. We both have played these sports since we were younger. So,
	we're going based off the surface information to inform you on the basic
	knowledge of the sports. This information won't educate you on how to play
	the sport but will go into some detail about how they compare to one
	another. While doing so, we will be comparing the differences between both
	sports. Below are the few broad and important topics we will be explaining,
	along with some equipment sale suggestions to end with.</p>
