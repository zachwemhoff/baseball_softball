	<h2 class="even_heading">About Pitching</h2>
	<p>When comparing pitching between baseball and softball the first noticeable
	thing is how the windups are significantly different. In baseball it's an
	overhand throw to pitch and they are sixty feet away from home plate. But, in
	softball they pitch an underhand throw and are pitching from forty three
	feet away. Although people think baseball is harder from the looks at it
	with the distance of everything because it's so much longer/bigger, there
	is a lot of different aspects that go into it.</p>

	<p>Although baseball pitchers reach a higher velocity, with softball being 
	a shorter distance the speeds and reaction times are very comparable. Another
	difference between the two sports is that baseball players are pitching off
	of an elevated mound as opposed to softball players from even ground in a
	circle. The main pitches thrown in softball consist on a fastball,
	changeup, curveball, and a rise and drop ball. In baseball the most common
	pitches are a four seam fastball, a two seam fastball, a curveball, a
	slider, and a changeup.</p>

	<p>Another big impact in the difference between pitching in baseball or
	softball is the size of the ball. Baseballs are white with red seams and
	softball are yellow with red seams. The size of a baseball is nine inches (in
	circumference) and a a softball is ten inches (in circumference). With the
	baseball being smaller it's easier to hold onto and this makes it easier
	with different grips allowing them to have many types of pitches to throw
	compared to softball. But pitches like the drop and rise ball in softball
	are movements baseball players don't see.</p>

	<p>Pitching in both sports is also a mentally straining activity. Successful
	 Pitchers must understand what a batter excels at and where they can take
	 advantage of their weaknesses. Additionally, pitchers will begin to switch
	 up the order of pitches they throw the second and third time through the batting
	 order. Pitchers will start the game throwing fastballs first, then off-speed.
	 As the game goes on, pitchers will begin to throw off-speed pitches first,
	 and then fastballs at the end of the at bat to keep the hitters off guard.
	 All of this makes pitching a physically and mentally strenuous activity.</p>
